    7 Simple Ways To Improve Your Mental Wellness</a></h1>
  <h2>Evan Jarschauer</h2>
  <p>If your lifestyle is anything like mine, finding the time to properly
    take care of your mental wellness can be a real challenge.
    After all, time is always of the essence, and it’s usually in short supply,
    especially since you are a real go-getter with a passion for being the best at whatever
    you do, whether at work or play.</p>
    <p>With all of those flights to catch, deadlines to meet, and loved ones in need of your full and undivided attention, there never seems to be enough time in the day to get it all done. And for most of us overachieving socially conscientious individuals, that usually means working long hard hours building our brands, vigorously networking with potential consumers, overcoming constant objections, and aggressively marketing our goods and services wherever and whenever the opportunity presents itself</p>
    <p>First things first. What is mental wellness all about? It essentially refers to properly taking care of your mental health, which includes your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It helps determine how you handle stress, relate to others, and make critical decisions in life.</p>
    <p>For the most part, it is greatly influenced by environmental life experiences and genetic predisposition. Nevertheless, although you may not be able to genetically erase a family history of depression nor substance abuse for that matter, I am confident that you do have the power to improve the environmental factors that impact your mental health by implementing a variety of practical strategies to do so.</p>
    <p>So, let’s take a look at some real-life practical examples of strategies that everyone should be able to work into even the most time-constricted schedule.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1. Talk to Someone</h3>
    <p><strong>That sounds simple enough, right? </strong>Unfortunately, however, not all of us feel as though we are capable of opening up about our feelings, nor do we have the time to share them constructively with another person. In fact, many people find themselves stuffing their feelings away—deep within the emotional bedrock of underlying and unresolved childhood issues.</p>
  <h3>2. Read a Book</h3>
  <p>I know what you’re thinking: Who has the time to read a book? However, studies have shown that reading significantly reduces symptoms of both depression and anxiety.
  </p>
  <p>Reading is like taking your mind on an all-expenses-paid vacation to Tahiti, the Renaissance, the future, and beyond in less than an hour—all from the comfort of your own home. Reading essentially forces you to pay attention to detail, so you don’t miss any of the important plot twists in the story.
  </p>
  <p>So, go ahead, carefully grab a hot cup of cocoa, find the most comfortable and quiet spot in your home, put your phone on vibrate, and read a novel by your favorite author. Although you may not be able to finish it in one sitting, schedule enough time to make it through at least a chapter or two.
  </p>
  <p>More than likely, the more you read, the more engaged you will find yourself in the story, and therefore, the more you will want to continue reading to find out exactly what happens in the end.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>3. Go for a walk</h3>
  <p>I am neither a cardiologist nor a professional fitness trainer. However, I do know that I feel great after going for a walk. It’s an uplifting and invigorating experience that’s as good for your heart as it is for your mind. Going for a walk can help improve your mental wellness.</p>
